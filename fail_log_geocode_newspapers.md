# Plotting the locations of newspapers in Wales
I would like to map the locations of newspapers in Wales published on:
http://newspapers.library.wales.  
This will enable me to see the geographic coverage of stories during World War I.

search this page:
http://newspapers.library.wales/browse
For these lines

'''
<h2 class="result-title">
  <a href="http://newspapers.library.wales/browse/3457718">
'''
  
So that I can access data from a page like this:
http://newspapers.library.wales/browse/mods/4024370

Database the metadata, geocode it and plot it on a map.
